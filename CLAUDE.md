# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

KinjoCore is a Swift Package Manager (SPM) library that provides the service layer for macOS and iOS applications. It targets **Swift 6.2 exclusively** with **minimum deployment targets of iOS 26 and macOS 26**. There is no need to maintain backward compatibility with older OS versions.

### Purpose
KinjoCore serves as the core service layer that will be integrated into both macOS and iOS applications, providing shared business logic and data management capabilities.

## Development Commands

### Building
```bash
swift build
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
swift test

# Run tests with verbose output
swift test --verbose

# Run a specific test
swift test --filter <test-name>
```

### Cleaning Build Artifacts
```bash
swift package clean
```

### Generate Xcode Project (if needed)
```bash
swift package generate-xcodeproj
```

## Documentation & Code Style

### Language
All documentation and code comments in this project must be written in **British English**.

This applies to:
- README files
- Code comments and documentation comments (`///` doc comments)
- CHANGELOG or other documentation files
- Error messages and user-facing strings
- Test descriptions

Examples of British English spelling:
- Use "synchronise" not "synchronize"
- Use "colour" not "color"
- Use "behaviour" not "behavior"
- Use "initialise" not "initialize"
- Use "organise" not "organize"

**Note:** Commit messages (Conventional Commits) should also follow British English conventions.

## Git Workflow

### Commit Message Format
This project uses **Conventional Commits** for all commit messages.

Format:
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Required Types:**
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code formatting, missing semicolons, etc. (no code change)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring (no functional changes)
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `build:` - Build system or dependency changes
- `ci:` - CI/CD configuration changes
- `chore:` - Other changes (tooling, configs, etc.)

**Examples:**
```
feat: add EventKit task synchronization service
fix: resolve SwiftData iCloud sync conflict
docs: update CLAUDE.md with licensing information
refactor: improve service initialization pattern
test: add unit tests for FoundationModels integration
```

**Guidelines:**
- Use lowercase for type and description
- Keep the description concise (50 characters or less)
- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added" or "adds")
- Add scope in parentheses when relevant: `feat(eventkit): add reminder support`
- Include breaking changes with `BREAKING CHANGE:` in footer or `!` after type: `feat!: change service API`
- **Do not mention** EUPL 1.2 licence headers or British English documentation adherence in commit messages (these are project standards and don't need to be stated in every commit)
- **Keep commit messages compact**: Be informative but concise. Avoid overly verbose bodies - focus on key changes and rationale, not exhaustive implementation details
- **Do not include test counts or results** in commit messages (e.g., "17 tests passing", "69 tests total") - tests are verified by CI and the counts change frequently

## Code Architecture

### Package Structure
- **Sources/KinjoCore/**: Contains the library source code
  - Main entry point: `KinjoCore.swift`
- **Tests/KinjoCoreTests/**: Contains test suites
  - Uses Swift Testing framework (not XCTest)
  - Tests can be run with `@Test` macro

### Service Layer Integration
Services provided by KinjoCore are designed to be injected into the iOS and macOS applications using **SwiftUI Environment**.

Key principles:
- All services should be defined as observable classes (using `@Observable` macro)
- Services are exposed to the app layer via SwiftUI's environment system
- Use `@Environment` property wrapper in views to access services
- Services should be registered in the app's entry point using `.environment()` modifier

Example pattern:
```swift
// In KinjoCore - Service definition
@Observable
public class MyService {
    // Service implementation
}

// In iOS/macOS App - Service registration
@main
struct MyApp: App {
    private let myService = MyService()

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                .environment(myService)
        }
    }
}

// In Views - Service usage
struct ContentView: View {
    @Environment(MyService.self) private var myService
    // Use service
}
```

### Testing Framework
This project uses the **Swift Testing** framework (introduced in Swift 5.9+), NOT XCTest. Key differences:
- Use `@Test` attribute instead of `XCTestCase` classes
- Use `#expect(...)` for assertions instead of `XCTAssert...`
- Tests can be async by default (`async throws`)
- Import tests with `@testable import KinjoCore`

### Swift Version
The project requires Swift 6.2 or higher (`swift-tools-version: 6.2` in Package.swift).

## Core Technologies & Frameworks

### EventKit
- **Primary data storage and synchronisation technology**
- Uses EventKit for task management and synchronisation
- **Full recurrence rule support** for repeating reminders (EKRecurrenceRule)
- Supports complex recurrence patterns including positional rules (e.g., "first Monday", "last Friday")
- Only use APIs available in iOS 26+ and macOS 26+ versions of EventKit
- No need to handle deprecated or legacy EventKit APIs

### FoundationModels
- Integration with Apple's **FoundationModels** framework for AI functionality
- Use the latest version available for iOS 26+ and macOS 26+
- Provides AI-powered features within the service layer

### SwiftData
- Used for storing application-specific data (not task data - that's in EventKit)
- **iCloud synchronization** enabled for all SwiftData models
- All persistent data should be defined using SwiftData models
- Ensure models are designed with iCloud sync in mind (consider sync conflicts, model versioning)

### Platform Requirements
- **Minimum iOS version:** 26.0
- **Minimum macOS version:** 26.0
- **Swift version:** 6.2 (exclusively)
- No backward compatibility required - always use the latest APIs available

## Licensing

This project is licensed under the **EUPL 1.2** (European Union Public Licence v. 1.2).

### License Headers
**All new source code files must include the EUPL 1.2 license header** at the top of the file.

Required header format for Swift files:
```swift
// Copyright (C) [Year] [Copyright Holder]
//
// Licensed under the EUPL, Version 1.2 or â€“ as soon they will be approved by
// the European Commission - subsequent versions of the EUPL (the "Licence");
// You may not use this work except in compliance with the Licence.
// You may obtain a copy of the Licence at:
//
// https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/software/page/eupl
//
// Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software
// distributed under the Licence is distributed on an "AS IS" basis,
// WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.
// See the Licence for the specific language governing permissions and
// limitations under the Licence.
```

When creating new files:
- Add the license header at the very top of each `.swift` file
- Replace `[Year]` with the current year
- Replace `[Copyright Holder]` with the appropriate copyright holder information
- Ensure the header is present before any `import` statements

## Important Notes

- The project uses Swift 6.2's strict concurrency checking
- All new code should be compatible with Swift 6 concurrency model
- The library target has no external dependencies (modify Package.swift if adding dependencies)
- **Always add the EUPL 1.2 license header to new source files**
