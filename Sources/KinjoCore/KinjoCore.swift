/// KinjoCore provides the core service layer for task and reminder management.
///
/// This framework integrates with EventKit to provide a clean, Swift-native API
/// for managing reminders, tasks, and calendars across iOS and macOS applications.
///
/// ## Key Services
///
/// - ``PermissionService``: Manages EventKit permissions and provides access to the event store
/// - ``ReminderService``: Handles reminder lists and reminder operations
/// - ``CalendarService``: Handles calendars and event operations
///
/// ## Getting Started
///
/// Services are designed to be injected into your SwiftUI application using the environment:
///
/// ```swift
/// @main
/// struct MyApp: App {
///     private let permissionService = PermissionService()
///     private let reminderService: ReminderService
///     private let calendarService: CalendarService
///
///     init() {
///         self.reminderService = ReminderService(permissionService: permissionService)
///         self.calendarService = CalendarService(permissionService: permissionService)
///     }
///
///     var body: some Scene {
///         WindowGroup {
///             ContentView()
///                 .environment(permissionService)
///                 .environment(reminderService)
///                 .environment(calendarService)
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
