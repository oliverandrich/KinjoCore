/// Represents a text annotation for a portion of the parsed input.

/// ## Example Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// let input = "Meeting morgen 14:00 p1 @Arbeit"
/// let task = parser.parse(input)
///
/// for annotation in task.annotations {
///     switch annotation.type {
///     case .scheduledDate:
///         highlightText(annotation.text, color: .blue)  // "morgen"
///     case .time:
///         highlightText(annotation.text, color: .green)  // "14:00"
///     case .priority:
///         highlightText(annotation.text, color: .red)    // "p1"
///     case .project:
///         highlightText(annotation.text, color: .purple) // "@Arbeit"
///     default:
///         break
///     }
