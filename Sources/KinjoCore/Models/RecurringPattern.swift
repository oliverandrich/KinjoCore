///
/// This type defines how often and on which days a task repeats.
/// It can express simple patterns like "daily" or "weekly", as well as

///
/// ## Examples
///
/// ```swift
/// // Daily
/// RecurringPattern(frequency: .daily, interval: 1)
///
/// // Every 3 days
/// RecurringPattern(frequency: .daily, interval: 3)
///
/// // Every Monday
/// RecurringPattern(frequency: .weekly, daysOfWeek: [.monday])
///
/// // Every Monday and Wednesday
/// RecurringPattern(frequency: .weekly, daysOfWeek: [.monday, .wednesday])
///
/// // Every first Monday of the month
/// RecurringPattern(frequency: .monthly, daysOfWeek: [.monday], weekOfMonth: 1)
///
/// // Every last Friday of the month
/// RecurringPattern(frequency: .monthly, daysOfWeek: [.friday], weekOfMonth: -1)
///
/// // Monthly on the 1st
/// RecurringPattern(frequency: .monthly, dayOfMonth: 1)
/// ```
