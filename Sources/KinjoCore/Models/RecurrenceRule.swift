/// for specifying how and when a reminder should repeat.

/// ## Examples
///
/// ```swift
/// // Every day
/// let daily = RecurrenceRule(frequency: .daily)
///
/// // Every 2 weeks
/// let biweekly = RecurrenceRule(frequency: .weekly, interval: 2)
///
/// // Every Monday and Friday
/// let weekdays = RecurrenceRule(
///     frequency: .weekly,
///     daysOfTheWeek: [.every(.monday), .every(.friday)]
/// )
///
/// // First Monday of every month, 12 times
/// let firstMonday = RecurrenceRule(
///     frequency: .monthly,
///     daysOfTheWeek: [.first(.monday)],
///     end: .afterOccurrences(12)
/// )
///
/// // Last Friday of every month
/// let lastFriday = RecurrenceRule(
///     frequency: .monthly,
///     daysOfTheWeek: [.last(.friday)]
